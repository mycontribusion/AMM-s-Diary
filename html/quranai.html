    <p>In a previous post, a reference was made to Prof. Isa Ali Pantami statement on Islam and AI.
    </p><p>Here are some links, one is an article the other a research. 
    </p><p>Article: (2 pages only)

    </p><p>Research: (6 pages only)

And we would have professionals that would be able to put them in their place.
