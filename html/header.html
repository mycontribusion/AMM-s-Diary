    <p>Comparing Header vs Payload:

    </p><p>With

    </p><p>Envelope vs A message

    </p><p>With just the message alone no one knows who the message is for. And even if it gets to the target luckily the target won't know the sender.

    </p><p>But with the envelope which has on it both information except for the message, the envelope and message can serve their purposes in establishing a communication. 

    </p><p>Likewise the relationship between the header and the Payload (which can be just a word, or a code that is sent to the target examples are, usernames, passwords, sentences, images, audio etc).
